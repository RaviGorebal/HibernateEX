INVERSE
*******

If you think about the relation between two classes, it may give an idea that student has 
addresses. (Student -> Addresses)So, it feels like a student is an owner, and an address is a child. 
Then, you want to think that address is "inverse=true" because address is owned by student.
However, it's not correct.

Here, I'd like to suggest a way to think about it.

Let's look at table structure instead of classes.

    * STUDENT [STUDENT_ID, NAME, ...]
    * ADDRESS [ADDRESS_ID, STUDENT_ID, CITY, STREET,...]


The STUDENT_ID column in ADDRESS table is the relational information between these two 
tables. So, ADDRESS is an owner of the relationship, and STUDENT is the inverse side.
"inverse=true" means "this side is the inverse side", and "inverse=false" means "this is 
not the inverse side. this side is the owner of the relationship".
