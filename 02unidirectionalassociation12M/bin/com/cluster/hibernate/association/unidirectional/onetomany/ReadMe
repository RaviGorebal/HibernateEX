CASCADE
*******
1) cascade="none", the default, tells Hibernate to ignore the association.

2) cascade="save-update" tells Hibernate to navigate the association when the transaction is committed 
   and when an object is passed to save() or update() and save newly instantiated transient instances 
   and persist changes to detached instances.
   
3) cascade="delete" tells Hibernate to navigate the association and delete persistent instances when 
   an object is passed to delete().
   
4) cascade="all" means to cascade both save-update and delete, as well as calls to evict and lock.

5) cascade="all-delete-orphan" means the same as cascade="all" but, in addition, Hibernate deletes 
   any persistent entity instance that has been removed (dereferenced) from the association 
   (for example, from a collection).
   
6) cascade="delete-orphan" Hibernate will delete any persistent entity instance that has been removed 
   (dereferenced) from the association (for example, from a collection).
